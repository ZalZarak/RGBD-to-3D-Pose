# functions must take and return np.ndarray([25, 3]).
# This will be applied after 3d joints are extracted and validated.
# But before any other transforms, e.g. the joints are in camera space, not in "real" space.
# So, neither flips (90Â° camera rotations), nor translations nor rotation were applied at this point.
# undetected joints are (0,0,0).
# unvalidated joints have z=0, e.g. (x,y,0).
# This should stay this way, e.g. (0,0,0) should stay (0,0,0) and (x,y,0) should stay (x,y,0).
# A joint with (x,y,z) with z!=0 must not become (a,b,0).
